- Sets: Creating unique collections
- Set Operations: Union, intersection, difference
- Duplicate Removal: Using sets for data cleaning

---

## 📅 Day 5: Functions & Modules
**Files:**  
- src/Day 5/main.py  
- src/Day 5/math_operations.py

**Topics Covered:**
- Functions: Defining and calling functions
- Arguments & Return Values
- Variable Scope: Local vs Global
- Built-in Modules: Importing standard Python modules
- Custom Modules: Creating and importing user-defined modules
- Code Organization: Separating logic into reusable components
- Real-world Practice: Power calculation and average computation

---

## Day 7: Key Learnings

- **Working with Files:** Learned how to open, read, write, and append data to files, enabling programs to store information persistently.
- **Safe Resource Management:** Understood how using `with open()` automatically closes files after use, helping prevent memory leaks and file corruption.
- **CSV Data Handling:** Learned the basics of reading and processing CSV files to work with structured, tabular data.
- **Error Handling Techniques:** Gained experience using `try` and `except` blocks to handle errors gracefully without crashing the program.

## Day 7: File Handling

### 📘 Topics Covered

#### 1. Introduction to File Reading & Writing
- Learned the basics of reading from and writing to files in Python.
- Understood different file modes such as read (`r`), write (`w`), and append (`a`).

#### 2. Context Managers using `with open()`
- Studied how context managers ensure files are properly closed after use, even if an error occurs.
- Learned why the `with open()` syntax is the recommended approach for file handling in Python.
- Understood how improper file handling can lead to memory leaks and resource exhaustion in larger applications.

**Example:**
```python
with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
